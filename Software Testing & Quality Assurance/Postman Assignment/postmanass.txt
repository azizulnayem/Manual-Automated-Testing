For this case, mention any other information
that I used as part of that test case. Please explain each test case - describe the
goal/purpose, as well as the assertions i used to verify the behavior.

Test Case 1: Create an employee

Request Type: POST
Request Body:
{
"name": "John Doe",
"salary": "5000",
"age": "30"
}
Goal/Purpose: Test if an employee can be successfully created with valid input data.
Tests:
Verify that the status code is 200.
Verify that the response body contains the created employee data.

Test Case 2: Get all employees

Request Type: GET
Request Body: None
Goal/Purpose: Test if all employees can be successfully retrieved.
Tests:
Verify that the status code is 200.
Verify that the response body contains an array of all employees.

Test Case 3: Get employee by ID

Request Type: GET
Request Body: None
Goal/Purpose: Test if an employee can be successfully retrieved by their ID.
Tests:
Verify that the status code is 200.
Verify that the response body contains the employee data for the requested ID.

note:
If you are getting the error "Response body contains employee data for requested ID | AssertionError: expected undefined to deeply equal 5" even though the ID you provided is in the list, it could be due to the fact that the API response is not returning the expected data.

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

Check the API response by inspecting the response body in Postman to ensure that the employee data for the requested ID is present.

If the data is not present, double-check that you are using the correct endpoint and ID.

If the data is present, try modifying the assertion in your test case. Instead of using "pm.response.json().id", you can try using "pm.response.json().data.id" or "pm.response.json().employee_id" (depending on the API response format).

Alternatively, you can try changing the ID to a different value and see if that resolves the error.

Finally, make sure to save and re-run your test case after making any changes.


Test Case 4: Update an employee

Request Type: PUT
Request Body:
{
"name": "John Doe",
"salary": "6000",
"age": "35"
}
Goal/Purpose: Test if an employee can be successfully updated with valid input data.
Tests:
Verify that the status code is 200.
Verify that the response body contains the updated employee data.

Test Case 5: Delete an employee

Request Type: DELETE
Request Body: None
Goal/Purpose: Test if an employee can be successfully deleted by their ID.

{
"name": "",
"salary": "5000",

{
"name": "",
"salary": "6000",
"age": "35"
}

Verify that the status code is 200.
Verify that the response body contains an array of all employees.

Note: Response time may vary depending on network conditions, server load, and other factors. It's a good idea to run this test multiple times and take the average response time to get a more accurate measurement.

how can i do all of them is postman
To create these test cases in Postman, follow these steps:

Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request type to the appropriate method (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE).
Enter the URL for the REST API endpoint.
If required, enter the request body in the appropriate format (JSON in this case).
In the Tests tab, write the assertions that need to be tested for the API call.
Save the request in Postman and run the test.
Here's an example of how you can create the first test case in Postman:

Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request type to GET and enter the URL: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees.
In the Tests tab, write the following assertions:
scss
Copy code
pm.response.to.have.status(200);
pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
pm.response.to.have.jsonBody();
Save the request and name it "Get All Employees".
Click the "Send" button to run the test and see the results.
You can follow a similar process to create the remaining test cases. Simply modify the request type, request body, and assertions as needed for each test case.
