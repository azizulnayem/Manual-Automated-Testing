Tasks for Testing API Endpoints Using Postman


● Task 1: Test User Registration
○ Use the POST method to send a request to the auth/register/ endpoint.
○ Create a new user with username and password.
○ Verify the response status code is 201 and check if the returned data matches
the registered user details.
○ Write a Test Script in Postman to verify the status code 201.


● Task 2: Test Blog Listing
○ Use the GET method to request the blogs/ endpoint.
○ Ensure you provide valid authentication credentials. Use the created username
and password to authenticate. Use Basic Auth for authentication.
○ Verify that the response status is 200 if authentication is successful.
○ Ensure the response contains a list of blogs in JSON format. And it follows the
structure mentioned in the documentation.
○ Write a Test Script in Postman to verify the status code 200.


● Task 3: Test Blog Creation
○ Use the POST method to send a request to the blogs/ endpoint.
○ Create a new blog with a title and content.
○ Ensure the correct response code 201 is returned if the blog is successfully
created.
○ Verify that valid authentication is required for this request.
○ Write a Test Script in Postman to verify the status code 201.


● Task 4: Generate Newman Report
○ Generate a Newman report for all the scripts you’ve written for the past 3 tasks.


Submission Guideline:


● Save all requests to a collection.
● Export the collection and write the URL in a text or docs file in a Google Drive folder.
● Use Newman to generate test reports. Take a screenshot of the Newman report and
upload that to the Google Drive folder.
● Share the Google Drive link. Make sure it is public.


Notes:
● Make sure the shared Google Drive folder contains a text/doc file containing your
Postman collection URL and a screenshot of your Newman report.
